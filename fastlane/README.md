# Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

For _fastlane_ installation instructions, see [Installing _fastlane_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/#installing-fastlane)

# Available Actions

## Android

### android screenshots

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android screenshots
```

Build the debug APK + test APK, capture raw store-listing screenshots in every locale

(into fastlane/metadata/android — F-Droid's plain set), then composite the framed/

captioned marketing set (into fastlane/metadata/android-play) for Play Store upload.

### android playstore

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android playstore
```

Build the Play release AAB and upload it plus store listing metadata to Google Play

Defaults to a dry run (validate_only) against the internal track — pass track:production

and validate_only:false to actually publish.

### android metadata

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android metadata
```

Upload only the store-listing text (titles/descriptions) to Google Play — no build,

no AAB, no images, no changelogs. For listing-copy fixes between releases.

Defaults to a dry run; pass validate_only:false to publish.

### android images

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android images
```

Upload only store screenshots/images to Google Play — no build, no AAB, no listing

text, no changelogs. For refreshed screenshots between releases.

Reads from fastlane/metadata/android-play, the framed/captioned marketing set generated

by `./gradlew :tools:screenshot-composer:run` — NOT fastlane/metadata/android, which

stays plain/raw for F-Droid.

Defaults to a dry run; pass validate_only:false to publish.

### android changelogs

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android changelogs
```

Upload only changelogs (release notes) to Google Play — no build, no AAB, no images,

no listing text. For fixing or adding a missed changelog translation after a release.

Requires version_code (the release this changelog belongs to).

Defaults to a dry run; pass validate_only:false to publish.

### android release

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane android release
```

Tag, reproducibly build, sign, and publish a GitHub release for F-Droid.

Run this only after the version bump + changelog commit is already made and pushed-

worthy — see project release checklist. Pauses for confirmation before anything public

(push, GitHub release) happens; the docker build and signing run first so you can see

the real SHA-256 before deciding.
